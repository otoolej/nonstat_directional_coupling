Features of Nonstationary Directional Coupling
===============================================

Matlab code to generate the feature set used in the publication:

`JM O'Toole, EM Dempsey, D Van Laere, Nonstationary coupling between heart rate and
perfusion index in extremely preterm infants over the first day of life, in
preparation, 2019.`



# Functions

  * 2D fractal measure: `fd_curves.m`
  * Hjorth parameters: `hjorth_feats.m`
  * Short-time information partial directed coherence (ST-iPDC): `shorttime_iPDC.m`
  * 
  * 


# Examples

To generate the 4 time-varying bi-variate autoregressive examples and plot (Figure 3):

```
>> gen_STiPDC_all_signals();
```

Plot examples for 2D fractal dimension measure (extension of the Higuchi approach)
```
>> plot_FD_examples()
```
